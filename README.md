# printf
## Author: Bobby Yang && Elaine Yeung (Batch 2)

## Synopsis
This is a custom implementation of `printf` from the standard library `<stdio.h>`.

## File Breakdown

## Using
For this command you will need to be in the `root` project folder, not the `main` folder. As you'll be compiling the `main/0-main.c` file in the `main` folder and the `0-sum_them_all.c` file in the current directory.

## TODO
- [ ] Get [@Julien Barbier](https://github.com/jbarbier) to say I did a good job ;)
