.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBint _printf(const char *\fR\fIformat\fR\fB, ...);\fR
.SH CONFIGURATION
.SH DESCRIPTION
The  functions in the _printf() family produce output according to a format as described below.  The functions _printf() write output to stdout, the standard output stream.

.B Return value

Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

.B Format of the format string

The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a 
.I conversion specifier

.. In between there may be (in this order) zero or more flags, an optional minimum field width, an optional precision and an optional length modifier.
